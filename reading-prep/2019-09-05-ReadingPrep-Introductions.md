## Questions or Observations

1. From the first reading: The description of the Allatians reminds me of musical scores: even with a sophisticated system of symbols, words, numbers, etc., some of the details of how the music is to be played according to the composer can get lost. It’s impossible to comprehensively put down into words and symbols an experience that goes so far beyond words. The Allatians have found a solution to a similar problem by recording the exact vibration and inflection of the author as they speak their ‘writing’.

2. From the first reading (Ken Liu): When reading the d escription of the Hesperoe, I wondered: is the only purpose of books to immortalize the thoughts or ideas of a person? Does immortality make books completely unnecessary? My instinct is telling me no, but I can’t give a concrete reason as to why books would still be necessary in a world where the authors can live on forever to share their thoughts.

3. From the third reading (Leah Price), page 35: this passage is starting to shift the way I think about books. Books do not have to be, themselves, unchanging or a snapshot of time. In a way, the reader transforms the book, and the story behind the book: what it was used for, why it was important, etc. This doesn’t change the text itself, but has a profound impact on the book itself and the story it tells to historians.
