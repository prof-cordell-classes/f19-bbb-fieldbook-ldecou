# Reading Prep: Print I

#### Lia DeCoursey

## Questions or Observations

1. The Stephen Fry movie really made me appreciate how badly people were needing/wanting print technology. The processes the Stephen witnesses and takes part in are so tedious, and he has many headstarts that Gutenberg didn't have. Plus, he only printed one page. The amount of manual work that must have gone into developing and implementing the letter press is a pretty good indidcator of how important books were / are to us.

2. How can we repurpose/revive an outdated technology in a meaningful way?
	+ incorporate it with a newer technology to improve it (dicussed in the Wired article)
	+ maybe it has some inherent stylistic/artistic advantage (brought up in the how-to article, positive brand identity)

3. While watching the Stephen Fry movie and reading the first couple of articles, I was skeptical that much of the appeal of letterpress printing was anything more than another example of our fascination with vintage things. However, the end of the inbot design article is changing my mind a bit: it can be an opportunity for a company to add a handmade touch which can show an attention to detail and appreciation for the small things that is appealing to customers.
