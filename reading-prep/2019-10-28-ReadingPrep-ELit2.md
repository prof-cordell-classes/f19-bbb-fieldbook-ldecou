# Reading Prep: E-Lit II

#### Lia DeCoursey

##Questions/Observations

1. The piece of E-Lit I chose to look at from the electronic literature collection was a piece called soundpoems by Joerg Piringer. I thought it was interesting to explore the different way that the reader could interact with the soundpoems. For example, in the "food chain" section, the user could either randomly click around and let the consonant and vowel sounds form arbitrarily, or intentionally click in front of a consonant to make a certain consonant-vowel pair.

2. Playing around with The Deletionist, I think that this project is a really important representation of alternative books. A lot of times, these alternative books are not about creating something completely new,  but rather about creating work out of things that we don't consider creative or interesting.

3. It is interesting to me, some of the parallels between the early forms of the codex and the early forms of e-lit. To think of either as being only accessible by academics or experts in the field is a bit strange, but that is how they both started.
