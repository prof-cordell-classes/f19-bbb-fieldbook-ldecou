# Reading Prep: Fabrication II: Paper Circuits

#### Lia DeCoursey

### Questions/Observations

1. How can an author/artist give the reader choice in how they interact with a work while maintaining the intended message or purpose for their book? Both Hichar and Holl-Jensen discuss ways that a reader might decide to read their books. Hichar even says that while he intends for the reader not to see or think about the mechanisms that drive the animation in his book, it is still possible for them to "pull back the curtain". These book forms differ from a standard codex, or even many forms of e-lit, because the reader has so much freedom over how they read the book.

2. The passage by Mozafari about using audio to point out sexism throughout Kubla Khan reminds me of a discussion we had in class about how the form of the book can be in opposition to its content. I thought it was interesting to think of these paper circuit altered book forms as a format for criticism or satire.

3. I found the discussion in the second reading about the growing relationship between humanities and science to be really interesting. There is no longer a clear separation between natural and social sciences.
