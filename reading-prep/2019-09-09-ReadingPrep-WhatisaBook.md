# Reading Prep: What is a Book? (1)

#### Lia DeCoursey

## Questions or Observations

1. There are a lot of quotes in this book about what a book is. The ones the stood out to me are the ones that said/implied what a book is not. For example, it “must be narrowed to records in portable form”. I thought this was an interesting limitation on a book since I feel like there are probably non-portable books that are undeniably books.

2. The author emphasizes how multiple book technologies exist side by side for long periods of time. I wonder exactly why this occurs / what this says about our relationship with the book.

3. The author notes many important conceptual shifts that allowed the book to evolve and change its form/function. Some of the shifts that I noted as being interesting were:
	+ moving from spoken to written language
	+ from shapes depicting words to signs representing sounds
	+ the development of the author/reader relationship (ex: the reader writing in margins)
	+ a picture of the author as the originator: printing technology became less of an obstacle and allowed authors to publish their own works, make their identity more prominently attached to the work
	+ we have now moved far enough in order to see the book as "unnatural"
