# Reading Prep: What is a Book? (2)

#### Lia DeCoursey

## Questions/Observations

1. Observation (Chapter 3): We were talking on Monday about the relationship between the book's form and function. I really appreciated William Blake's work as an example of this. The current book form didn't quite fit the function Blake envisioned for his work, so he had to revert back to an "outdated" form and method of printing to make his writing.

2. Observation (Chapter 3): "The book is an exchange, and one that is only completed when we arrive." This is just my favorite description of a book so far. It occurs in context of Knowles's interactive books. I think this section captures the essence of the reader/author relationship.

3. Observation (Chapter 3): The author mentions John Cage, and I recognized that name. I realized that I know of him because of his composition 4'33, which is a musical score lacking any intentional music. I used to think the concept of writing a blank musical score was really silly, but now I see how this piece was influential because it emphasizes the importance of the reader/listener's interaction with the work.
