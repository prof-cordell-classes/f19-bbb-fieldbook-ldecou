# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

## Questions and Observations

1. I didn't really understand the passage in "The New Art of Making Books" about poetry. If poetry is meant to be said aloud, but it normally written and printed, how has it lost nothing? I feel like all of my high school English teachers were always reminding us that poetry needs to be read aloud, and that is sometimes the only way to understand the full impact of the poem. I wonder if the author is implying here that the way that a book of poems uses space in a more intentional way poetry is able to give back some of the meaning that is lost from not reading it aloud?

2. A common thread through a lot of these readings is the idea of creating something much bigger than ourselves. I think the Xenotext and the Future Library are the best examples of this. It's interesting to me how the idea of "bigger than ourselves" has changed so much over time. The first people to print and distribute books using the printing press must have felt the same way, yet the act of printing and distributing a book to other humans now seems like a trivial concept.

3. From the Emre Reading: "The artistic-environmental banks of the present decide what ordinary things — books, seeds — we will make extraordinary now, before they are lost, so we can imagine a world in which we never lost them in the first place." <br> <br> It's interesting to think of ourselves as writing our own history by choosing the things that we try to preserve for future civilizations to find. I think there is a certain danger in this, since the people who are able to have a hand in "writing out history" often come from more privileged groups. I feel like there's some social responsiblity to represent marginalized groups when taking on projects that involve our interaction with future generations.
