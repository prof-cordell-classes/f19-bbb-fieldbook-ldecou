# Reading Prep: E-Lit 1

#### Lia DeCoursey

1. What is the goal of e-readers/e-lit? The main two critics of digital readers that I've come across are 1) those who prefer the feeling of holding and turning the pages of a paper codex and 2) those who are disappointed by the lack of digital media that creatively uses digital interfaces to its advantage. This would suggest that there are at least two opposing goals for the future of e-lit. I guess it's sufficient to say that the goals of e-lit are different for different people, but I'm curious as to what others think of this.

2. Reading "What football will look like in the future", I was thinking about how the digital format really enhances the story in this situation. Being able to continuously scroll through conversations in that way emphasizes the passage of time in the narrative.

3. Reflecting on "The Deep Space of Digital Reading", I wonder what makes reading things that don't make sense enjoyable. I agree with the author that there is something about works that force you to constantly adjust your understanding of what's going on in the tex that you're reading. I wonder if it is the added challenge of having to build new situation models, or if there is something else about our interactions with books that makes this entertaining.
