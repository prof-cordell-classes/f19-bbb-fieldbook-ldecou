# Reading Prep: Binding

## Questions or Observations

1. I looked up some of the history/context of Baxter's Procrustes because I didn't really understand the text when I first read it, and I found that Chesnutt wrote it after being denied from a book club because he was African American. This made the undertones of social/class struggle even more apparent to me when revisting the text, and I think it's a really interesting contrast and follow-up to last week's discussions. Zines are inherently all substance with very little money put into the appearance of each copy, as they tend to be written by and for underrepresented or oppressed communities. 

2. At what point does a book lose its identity as a book? If we require a book to have some sort of consumable content, the book in Baxter's Procrustes isn't a book? But it still holds an important message even without having any words or images.
Looking to the "Oh Look, a Ferry" reading, I was puzzled by the following quote: "A large number of books that we own were eliminated from consideration, because they were needed for other purposes (for example, reading)." Can the purpose that we assign to a book strip the identifier 'book' away from it?

3. In “How to Design an Awarded Letterpress Printed Book”, the section about lay-flat binding and how they chose to style the covers of the book was a really interesting example of how the book and the text interact with one another. I think that in this class so far, I have usually separated the two in my mind, but the extra care that was taken to ensure that the form of the book supported and complemented the text reminds me that they are often intertwined, especially in many of the most thoughtful and impactful works.
