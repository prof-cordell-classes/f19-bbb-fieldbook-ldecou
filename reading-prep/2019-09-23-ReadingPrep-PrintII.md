## Questions or Observations

1. The section on justified/aligned text reminded me of discussions from last weeks class about the relationship between function and art. Page 118 discusses how "movable type imposed a new spatial order on the written word."  
Learning to set type has made me realize the significance of how text and space interact. These are things I often take for granted when typing on a computer.

2. It was interesting to read _Thinking with Type_, which placed many restrictions/rules over how type should be stylized or formatted, when graphic design is still very much a creative field. Coming from my own experiences in music, any rules that are imposed are susceptible to the "art is subjective" argument. I think that type is unique because it is at this function/art intersection, but I wonder if in the right context, the "type crimes" pointed out in _Thinking with Type_ could also be acceptable in the right context for a certain expressive purpose.


3. The font I chose to research was Chicago. I thought it was an interesting artifact of the interplay of function / art / nostalgia. The Kern Your Enthusiasm author had a special preference for this font that was born mostly out of practicality because it is a bitmap font. However, it was also the first digital font to have letters that were proportional. The author notes how this difference made using a Mac feel more personal or like a human experience.
