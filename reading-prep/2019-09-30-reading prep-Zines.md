# Reading Prep: Zines

#### Lia DeCoursey

## Questions or Observations

1. I'm starting to think more about different book definitions that we've discussed and to what extent I agree with them, and the end of the Epilogue from 'Zine says "I know I'll never move out of this house made of art", which reminded me of the concept we discussed that "A Book is a Home". To me, these ideas mean that a book provides some sort of comfort or shelter from the world. I appreciate this definitions for what it is, but I'm skeptical that it adequately encompasses all books. I don't know of many people, if anyone, who find a sense of home reading the average textbook, but a textbook is undeniably a book. It makes me think that I should steer towards something more utilitarian for my book definition, or perhaps there is a way to include things like textbooks in the "book is a home" definition, and I just haven't figured it out.

2. I appreciate the sentiment in "Why the Internet Didn't Kill Zines" that "just because technology can fully replace something doesnâ€™t mean it should." From these readings, I've gathered that an important aspect of a zine is the reader/author relationship, and I wonder if taking to the internet with a zine would change this relationship. It is my impression that zines also provide some amount of protection to authors that the internet cannot provide.

3. I'm not sure if this is at all significant, but I noticed that when clicking through the pages of Traces, clicking the next number at the bottom would navigate one full page, while clicking the arrows on the side of the screen would only navigate you a half page, so you'd see half of one page and half of the next. It seems like everything in this zine is purposeful, so I'm curious if there's any purpose to this. Maybe it is an attempt to make the reading experience more similar to a paper zine because it sort of gives a more fluid reading experience?
