# Reflective: Fabrication II: Paper Circuits

#### Lia DeCoursey

I wanted to start by reflecting on this passage from the first reading:

"Fluency, in contrast to literacy, affords creativity. If I am literate in a language, I can read, write, and speak it, but if I am fluent in a language I can write poetry or a novel or use the language in ways the literate cannot. Technological fluency is the ability to be creative with technology; it is a vital component in a participatory culture in which the design, use, and evaluation of technologies is an open process that goes beyond the purview of experts."

At first, I thought it was interesting to think of fluency/literacy in this way. To me, this statement implies that one can be fluent in a language with less knowledge than someone who is only literate. In terms of technological fluency in particular, I am reminded of our in-class activities with paper circuits. Someone with minimal electronics knowledge could still make some pretty creative things, especially with something as accessible as the paper circuits with accompanying instructions. I've definitely encountered students/professors in the physics department who are electronically "literate", but I would hesitate to consider all of them "fluent" in light of this passage. I suppose that instead of thinking of fluency as being a step beyond literacy (or as literacy being a prerequisite for fluency), it might in some contexts be more useful to think of them as completely different distinctions.

Another interesting discussion about bibliocircuitry in the first reading was the concept of "pulling back the curtain". My impression is that these paper circuit book forms allow for a lot more exploration on the reader's part to see the technology driving the work. Readers of a letterpress printed book or a digitally curated piece of electronic literature would not have the technological conception of the work so readily accessible to them. (Someone with the computational skills might be able to access the script that is driving the electronic literature, as well as explore it in a meaningful way, but I don't think this would apply to most of the audience.) However, unlike these forms, books with electronic components built in to them are easily accessible for the reader to pick apart and possibly generate some understanding of how they work together to produce the final product. It's interesting to think of how this changes the reader's relationship with the book; not only do they see the author's work in its final form in the way that the author intended, but they also get to witness pieces of the author's journey to create the work.

From the second reading: "While we do not intend for our critical making methods to be grounded in instrumental logic, we constantly negotiate between instrumental and aesthetic concerns when working with cultural institutions. Considerations abound, including how we can use 3-D printing to make museum objects “more interactive.” "

This section reminded me of when we looked at the 3D replicas of the books for the visually impaired that we looked at. I thought that they exemplified the intersection of humanities and science/technology in a really powerful way. It would not be practical to have a museum exhibit with the original books, which are very tactile and fragile objects. 3D printing and similar technologies allow us to tell important messages about different groups and their histories.
