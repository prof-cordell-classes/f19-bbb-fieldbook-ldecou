# Reflective Entry: Zines

#### Lia DeCoursey


This class has started to reshape my perception of many aspects of books and how we interact with them, one aspect in particular being the reader-author relationship. I had usually thought of books in a pretty narrow or traditional sense, and one assumption I had made was that authors always want more and more people to read their books. Our week's discussion on zines made me aware of the reasons that an author may want to keep their work private. I started to think about how this different, more intimate, author-reader relationship can affect the content of a zine.

One consequence of the private nature of zines that I thought of is the sincerity of the content within them. I think this was the first thing that struck me when we were able to look through the zines brought in by the guest lecturers from the library. There are probably some authors who are trying to get published and reach the widest audience for the sake of money and influence, and those efforts can sometimes lead to a loss of sincerity in the work. Making a bestselling novel sometimes requires some level of universal appeal or relatability. This is definitely a strength of zines in my mind. Since they are intended for a small audience, they can capture the author/artists' most genuine thoughts and feelings without the same external pressures to please the masses. I think back to the sample pages from Pagan Kennedy's zine, where she shares personal stories about her friends, a timeline of how her hair has looked throughout her life, and "My Dream Life Illustrated". I can hardly picture this kind of personal content in a bestselling or traditionally "successful" book.    

In some ways, this reminds me of the discussion we had in class about finsta accounts. I've never personally had an instagram account, let alone a finsta. One of the reasons I don't have an instagram account is what I perceive to be a lack of sincerity that exists on social media. I don't think this is a revolutionary opinion, but I have always looked at social media as a place where people are trying to mislead or convince each other that their lives are perfect. (Of course, I don't think of everyone having social media as being deceptive or misleading. This is just my generalization of something that I'm not very familiar with.) When I was first shown a finsta account, however, I immediately viewed it as being a more genuine representation of the person's life, partly because I knew that the audience was more limited than a typical Instagram account. 

I also think of popular musicians, who are often critised for changing after they develop a larger following. While this might sometimes just be people looking for something to criticize, I do think that this is a somewhat common phenomenon as an artist gains a larger audience and feels the need to please all of them.

Another quality of zines that could be attributed to their limited audience is their collaborative nature. I am reminded of _Traces_, and how each page was from a different author or artist. I think this is another strength of zines that comes from the smaller and more private audience. Since profit or large influence tends to be a smaller concern for zine artists, navigating the financial aspect of sharing a work or publication becomes less complicated. This allows for richer content incorporating multiple perspectives and experiences.

Our zine week has had quite the impact on how I view books and the way that the author-reader relationship can shape them. These are ideas that will definitely carry into my book report and my own definition of the book.
